I am a first-year CS Ph.D. student at Stanford University, working with Prof. Keith Winstein on the Stagecast project. Here is my [CV](https://alex-q-z.github.io/files/qizhengz_CV.pdf).

Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago. During my undergraduate years, I have been fortunate to work with Prof. Junchen Jiang and Prof. Ravi Netravali on video streaming and analytics. I have also interned at the Mathematics and Computer Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory.

My research interest is broadly in networking, applied machine learning, systems, and security. My past research has focused on video streaming and analytics, deep learning inference systems, etc. My recent research focuses on (1) loss-tolerant video encoding (2) "predictive" and low-latency video/audio streaming.

The pronunciation of my first name (Qizheng) is very close to that of "keygen" in public key encryption. I also go by Alex.

<!---
In particular, Iâ€™m interested in building high-performing and resource-efficient networked systems for emerging Internet applications.

<!---
Besides research, I really enjoy my coursework in computer science. For my introductory functional programming class, I've developed a fully functional Go game with ~2500 lines of Typed Racket code. For my networks class, I've implemented an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server, the TCP infrastrature, and a simple IP router. For my parallel programming class, I've implemented a parallelized data packet processor that allows work balancing with the use of a variety of locks like the TASLock, the Anderson Queue Lock, etc. I have also taken a number of courses in mathematics, statistics, and physics.<br />
