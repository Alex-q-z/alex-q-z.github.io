I am a senior undergraduate student studying computer science, mathematics and statistics at the University of Chicago, where I'm fortunate to work with Prof. Junchen Jiang on networked systems. Besides, I am fortunate to collaborate with Prof. Ravi Netravali (at Princeton) to work on video analytics.

Currently, my research interests lie broadly in systems and networking. During my undergraduate years, I focused primarily on building resource-efficient networked systems for video analytics applications. In particular, I am interested in using ideas from traditional systems like video codecs to design systems that handle emerging machine learning workloads.

I will be applying to PhD programs in Computer Science this autumn.

## Recent News
**[May 2020]** Our DDS paper has been accepted and is to appear in **SIGCOMM 2020**.<br />
<br />
**[Jun 2019]** This summer I'll be a student researcher at Argonne National Laboratory, working with Dr. Mark Hereld at the Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) Division. I will be contributing to the project LightningBug: Mass Digitization of Pinned Insect Specimens.

Besides research, I really enjoy my coursework in computer science. For my introductory functional programming class, I've developed a fully functional Go game with ~2500 lines of Typed Racket code. For my networks class, I've implemented an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server, the TCP infrastrature, and a simple IP router. For my parallel programming class, I've implemented a parallelized data packet processor that allows work balancing with the use of a variety of locks like the TASLock, the Anderson Queue Lock, etc. I have also taken a number of courses in mathematics, statistics, and physics.<br />
