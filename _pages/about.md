I am a rising second-year CS Ph.D. student at Stanford University, advised by Prof. Kunle Olukotun. I am currently working on developing programmable infrastructure for in-network machine learning as part of the Stanford Pervasive Parallelism Lab. My research interest is broadly in systems, networking, and applied machine learning. In addition, I have also had the privilege to work with:
- Prof. Keith Winstein, on the Stanford Stagecast project
- Prof. Kayvon Fatahalian, on human-centered virtual communication
- Prof. Muhammad Shahbaz, on infrastructure for in-network machine learning

Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago, with a triple major in computer science, statistics, and mathematics. During my undergraduate years, I have been fortunate to work with Prof. Junchen Jiang and Prof. Ravi Netravali on video streaming and analytics. I have also interned at the Mathematics and Computer Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory.

The pronunciation of my first name (Qizheng) is very close to that of "keygen" in public key encryption. I also go by Alex.
