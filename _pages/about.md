Hi there! I am a junior undergraduate student at the University of Chicago studying Mathematics and Computer Science. Currently, I am working with Prof. Junchen Jiang on video analytics and networked systems. My research interests lie broadly in systems and networking. Some of my recent work focuses on <br />
- System Support for DNN-based Video Analytics [DDS, SIGCOMM'20]
- System Support for Efficient Video Compression
- Customized Video Codec Design

## Recent News
**[May 2020]** Our DDS paper has been accepted and is to appear in **SIGCOMM 2020**.<br />
<br />
**[Jun 2019]** This summer I'll be a student researcher at Argonne National Laboratory, working with Dr. Mark Hereld at the Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) Division. I will be contributing to the project LightningBug: Mass Digitization of Pinned Insect Specimens.

## Research Projects
### Integrated Video Analytics Platform (At UChicago)
### DNN-Driven Streaming (At UChicago)
### LightningBug (at Argonne National Lab)
LightningBug is a system that enables mass digitization of pinned insect specimens. We work with museums across the US like the Field Museum and Yale Peabody  Museum of Natural History.

## Selected Personal Projects
I enjoy learning computer science by implementing the things myself. Here are some of my personal projects:

## Featured Coursework
- Mathematics and Statistics: Proof-based Calculus and Multivariate Calculus, Abstract Linear Algebra, Analysis in R^n I-II-III (accelerated track), Numerical Analysis, Markov Chains and Brownian Motions, Abstract Algebra I-II, Applied Regression Analysis, Statistical and Probability Theory I-II
- Computer Science: Data Structures, Functional Programming, Introduction to Computer Systems, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Computer Security, Parallel Computing, Graduate Operating Systems, Graduate Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Discrete Mathematics, Algorithms

<!---
Besides research, I really enjoy my coursework in computer science. For my introductory functional programming class, I've developed a fully functional Go game with ~2500 lines of Typed Racket code. For my networks class, I've implemented an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server, the TCP infrastrature, and a simple IP router. For my parallel programming class, I've implemented a parallelized data packet processor that allows work balancing with the use of a variety of locks like the TASLock, the Anderson Queue Lock, etc. I have also taken a number of courses in mathematics, statistics, and physics.<br />
