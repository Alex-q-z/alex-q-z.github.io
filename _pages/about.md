I am a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Chicago, studying Computer Science (with a specialization in Computer Systems), Mathematics, and Statistics. I am currently working with Prof. Junchen Jiang as a research assistant on video analytics and networked systems. In specific, I am interested in developing reliable and efficient networked systems that enable machine-centric video streaming with deep neural networks.

## News
**[May 2020]** Our DDS paper Server-Driven Video Streaming for Deep Learning Inference has been accepted and is to appear in **SIGCOMM 2020**. This summer I will continue to develop an integrated video analytics platform based on my learning from the DDS project.

**[Oct 2019]** I start to work with Prof. Junchen Jiang at UChicago CS as an undergraduate research assistant on computer networked systems and video analytics.

**[Jun 2019]** This summer I'll be a student researcher at Argonne National Laboratory, working with Dr. Mark Hereld at the Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) Division. I will be contributing to the project LightningBug: Mass Digitization of Pinned Insect Specimens.
