Hi there! I am currently a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Chicago. 

## News
**[May 2020]** Our DDS paper _Server-Driven Video Streaming for Deep Learning Inference_ has been accepted and is to appear in **SIGCOMM 2020**. This summer I will continue to develop an integrated video analytics platform based on my learning from the DDS project.

**[Oct 2019]** I start to work with Prof. Junchen Jiang at UChicago CS as an undergraduate research assistant on computer networked systems and video analytics.

**[Jun 2019]** This summer I'll be a student researcher at Argonne National Laboratory, working with Dr. Mark Hereld at the Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) Division. I will be contributing to the project _LightningBug: Mass Digitization of Pinned Insect Specimens_.
