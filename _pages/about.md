I am a senior undergraduate student studying computer science, mathematics and statistics at the University of Chicago, where I'm fortunate to work with Prof. Junchen Jiang. Besides, I am fortunate to collaborate with Prof. Ravi Netravali at Princeton University to work on video analytics. Previously, I have also interned as a research assistant at the Mathematics and Computer Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory, where I was supervised by Dr. Mark Hereld and Dr. Nicola J. Ferrier.

<!---
Currently, my research interests lie broadly in systems and networking. During my undergraduate years, I focused primarily on building high-performing and resource-efficient networked systems for video analytics applications.

My primary research interest is in computer systems and networking. In particular, Iâ€™m interested in building systems for large-scale and distributed workloads & applications. My past research has focused on video encoding and streaming systems, multimedia streaming systems, etc. I have worked extensively with machine learning and computer vision workloads.

More recently, I have been working on video encoding (with encoders like h264/h265 and VP8/9) to support video streaming under different network conditions.

The pronunciation of my first name (Qizheng) is very close to that of "keygen" (in public key encryption). I also go by Alex.

<!---
I am currently applying to PhD programs in Computer Science that start in Fall 2022.

<!---
Besides research, I really enjoy my coursework in computer science. For my introductory functional programming class, I've developed a fully functional Go game with ~2500 lines of Typed Racket code. For my networks class, I've implemented an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server, the TCP infrastrature, and a simple IP router. For my parallel programming class, I've implemented a parallelized data packet processor that allows work balancing with the use of a variety of locks like the TASLock, the Anderson Queue Lock, etc. I have also taken a number of courses in mathematics, statistics, and physics.<br />
