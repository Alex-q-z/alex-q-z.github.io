Hi there! I am a rising third-year undergraduate student at the University of Chicago studying Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics. Currently, I am working with Prof. Junchen Jiang as a research assistant on video analytics and networked systems. Last summer, I worked with Dr. Mark Hereld as a summer research intern at the Mathematics and Computer Science Division of Argonne National Laboratory on system design for large-scale digitalization of insect specimens.<br />

I am actively looking for a software engineering internship or a research internship (in systems and networking) position for summer 2021.

## Recent News
**[May 2020]** Our DDS paper has been accepted and is to appear in **SIGCOMM 2020**.

## Selected Personal Projects
I enjoy learning computer science by implementing the things myself. Here are some of my personal projects:

## Academic Coursework
Besides research, I really enjoy my coursework in computer science. For my introductory functional programming class, I've developed a fully functional Go game with ~2500 lines of Typed Racket code. For my networks class, I've implemented an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server, the TCP infrastrature, and a simple IP router. For my parallel programming class, I've implemented a parallelized data packet processor that allows work balancing with the use of a variety of locks like the TASLock, the Anderson Queue Lock, etc. I have also taken a number of courses in mathematics, statistics, and physics.<br />
