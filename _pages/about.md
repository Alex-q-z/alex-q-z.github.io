I am a rising third-year undergraduate student at the University of Chicago studying Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics. I am currently working with Prof. Junchen Jiang as a research assistant on video analytics and networked systems.

## News
**[May 2020]** Our DDS paper Server-Driven Video Streaming for Deep Learning Inference has been accepted and is to appear in **SIGCOMM 2020**. This summer I will continue to develop an integrated video analytics platform based on my learning from the DDS project.

**[Oct 2019]** I start to work with Prof. Junchen Jiang at UChicago CS as an undergraduate research assistant on computer networked systems and video analytics.

**[Jun 2019]** This summer I'll be a student researcher at Argonne National Laboratory, working with Dr. Mark Hereld at the Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) Division. I will be contributing to the project LightningBug: Mass Digitization of Pinned Insect Specimens.

## Coursework @UChicago
Besides research, I really enjoy my coursework in computer science, mathematics, and statistics. For my networks class, I've implemented an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server, the TCP infrastrature, and a simple IP router. For my parallel programming class, I've implemented a parallelized data packet processor that allows work balancing with a variety of locks like the TASLock, the Anderson Queue Lock, etc.
