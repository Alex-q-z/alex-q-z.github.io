Hi there! I am a junior undergraduate student at the University of Chicago studying Mathematics and Computer Science. Currently, I am working with Prof. Junchen Jiang on video analytics and networked systems. My research interests lie broadly in systems and networking. Some of my recent work focuses on <br />
- System Support for Video Analytics [DDS, SIGCOMM'20]
- Edge Computing
- Video Codec Design

I will be applying to Computer Science PhD programs in Autumn 2021.

## Recent News
**[May 2020]** Our DDS paper has been accepted and is to appear in **SIGCOMM 2020**.<br />
<br />
**[Jun 2019]** This summer I'll be a student researcher at Argonne National Laboratory, working with Dr. Mark Hereld at the Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) Division. I will be contributing to the project LightningBug: Mass Digitization of Pinned Insect Specimens.

<!---
Besides research, I really enjoy my coursework in computer science. For my introductory functional programming class, I've developed a fully functional Go game with ~2500 lines of Typed Racket code. For my networks class, I've implemented an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server, the TCP infrastrature, and a simple IP router. For my parallel programming class, I've implemented a parallelized data packet processor that allows work balancing with the use of a variety of locks like the TASLock, the Anderson Queue Lock, etc. I have also taken a number of courses in mathematics, statistics, and physics.<br />
